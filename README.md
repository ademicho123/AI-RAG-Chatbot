## Resolving Git Conflicts

When you encounter Git conflicts, follow these steps:

1. Open the file(s) with conflicts
2. Look for conflict markers:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your local changes
   =======
   Changes from remote/branch
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   ```
3. Edit the file to keep desired changes
4. Remove all conflict markers
5. Save the file
6. Stage changes: `git add .`
7. Commit: `git commit -m "Resolve conflicts"`
